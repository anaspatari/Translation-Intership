               <p class="lead">I have completed the translation internship at The Department for International Relations at Alecu Russo Balti State University. In my research about the office, I have found that the goal of the International Relations Office is to support the internationalization policy of the university, promotion of “Alecu Russo” Balti State University as a distinctive academic community both at the national and international level, as an educational, scientific and cultural center. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">- The Department for International Relations is available for people interested in partnerships with HEI, foreign organizations and institutions </p>
               <p class="lead">- Share information about the requirements for receiving scholarships in foreign countries funded by different national and international institutions and organizations; </p>
               <p class="lead">- Help in solving formalities regarding the mobilities at USARB of didactic, administrative staff and foreign students (incl. residence permit); </p>
               <p class="lead">-	Search partners for diverse international programs; </p>
               <p class="lead">-	Offer technical assistance for project elaboration;</p>
               <p class="lead">-	Contribute to the organization of seminars, sessions, scientific international forums, etc.; </p>
               <p class="lead">- Promote through mass-media different events at the university at the international relations department;</p>
               <p class="lead">-	Make and keep contact with foreign universities; </p>
               <p class="lead">- Establish contact with worldwide organizations, embassies, etc.;</p>
               <p class="lead">- As partners, we monitor the budget assigned for the international projects; </p>
               <p class="lead"> -Elaborate electronic presentations and information in Romanian and other languages to promote the university’s image in other countries.</p>
               <p class="lead">As an intern with the office, I had to translate two study programme handbooks, which will be used by the foreign students interested in studying at Alecu Russo Balti State University. I had to select only those contents, which include course's name, USARB code, department, area, description, learning outcomes, contents, teaching and learning methods, assessment methods and recommended reading. The last day I received another document (an article) for translation. My task was to translate it from English into Romanian. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">I am extremely grateful because of the lessons and skills I learned and the opportunities I had to apply these skills. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">To begin with, I have improved my time-management skills. I received two texts (written in Romanian) for translation on. It was pretty difficult to manage time, especially when I was working from home and having a huge deadline (up to 24 of May). Although I split my working hours using an improvised calendar, my working schedule differed from day to day. Sometimes, I worked 15 minutes per day, sometimes - the whole night. Then I tried a different takt, which was much more useful for me. I broke a large task down (two big texts) into more manageable pieces (small texts). As a result, I translated at least 3-4 course syllabi every day. The work was much more productive because a small task was not associated with negative emotions. The last document was quite easy, as I had to translate it into my mother tongue. The limited deadline did not scare me. Moreover, it motivated me to work faster and more efficiently.</p><br>
               <p class="lead">When I started my translation internship, the second course I have taken at The Front-End Development School was coming to the end. So, I decided to apply my basic coding skills to create my own design simple virtual portfolio for internship. Thus, an additional skill I have learned was that of the integration and synthesis. I integrated ideas from different sources to solve a larger problem. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">Another skill I have applied was logical thinking.  (If A = B and B = C and C=D, then deductive reasoning tells us that A = D). I used this skill when I translated terms and abbreviations. For example,  </p><br>
               <p class="lead">*if "masă monetară" = "totalitate a mijloacelor bănești existente în economia unei țări la un moment dat sau în medie pe o anumită perioadă", and  </p><br>
               <p class="lead">"the total volume of currency held by the public at a particular point in time" = "money supply (or money stock)", </p><br>
               <p class="lead"> then "masă monetară" = "money supply (or money stock)". </p><br>
               <p class="lead">Although I mostly used google translate, I also learned to work with other online CAT tools, such as SMARTCAT, which is often used professionally. Smartcat is a cloud-based translation and localization platform that connects businesses, translators, and translation agencies in a single “Connected Translation” delivery loop. The platform positions itself as an “all-in-one” translation platform, combining CAT, TMS, and other translation technologies. I liked it very much because of the fast speed, which saves time. However, machine translation has its own disadvantages. It can translate only cliched texts. I had always to make such transformation as portioning, integration, antonymic translation etc. by myself. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">As a consequence, I improved the ability of establishing translation difficulties and using the right method of translation.</p>
               <p class="lead">The critical issue I have met translating from Romanian into English, was the translation of long sentences. I always tried to use, as much as possible, only short sentences in order to avoid mistakes. And the translation of academic text (characterized by long sentences) was a real challenge for me.  </p><br>
             </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 me-auto">
               <p class="lead">In English compound sentences, main sentences are the main parts, which are usually placed at the beginning of the sentences. That is to say, English sentences usually use the position of front center. This "from one to many" western way of thinking tends to focus on the beginning of a sentence. In other words, in English, the conclusion is described first, and the facts are described at the end of the sentence. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">Example 1 (Romanian into English): </p>
               <p class="lead">"Odată cu dezvoltarea tehnicii de calcul a apărut necesitatea studierii tehnologiilor informaţionale și comunicaționale la diverse nivele ale activităţii umane, inclusiv şi în instituţiile de învăţământ atât preuniversitare, cât şi universitare." </p><br>
               <p class="lead">"There is a need to study information and communication technologies at various levels of human activity, including in both pre-university and university educational institutions because of the development of computer technology." </p>
               <p class="lead">Example 2 (English into Romanian): </p>
               <p class="lead">"Similar items were collated for comparison and contrast, and axial coding used to explore key themes." </p><br>
               <p class="lead">"Pentru comparație și contrast, au fost adunate articole similare, iar pentru a explora teme cheie a fost folosită codificarea axială." </p><br>
               <p class="lead">For the translation of English long sentences, the first thing is to carefully analyze the syntactic structure, an accurate understanding of sentence meaning, then adopt flexible translation methods for translation. The method of translation I have mostly used here was word order change (in order to preserve the aesthetic value of the original text and bring better reading experience to the readers as much as possible). </p><br>
               <p class="lead">Another problem I have met translating from Romanian into English, was the the failure of understanding the contextual meaning in the source text. More specifically, I had to concretize the meaning of each term, in order to avoid translation errors.  </p><br>
               <p class="lead">"e.g. Agent economic - Economic agent: A person or firm with the power to make decisions about output, investment, prices, etc [Rutherford, D., Routledge Dictionary of Economics, Taylor & Francis e-Library, 2005, 
                 <a href="http://library.wbi.ac.id/repository/79.pdf">see the source:</a>  </p><br>
               <p class="lead">"e.g. MS -DOS - MS-DOS (n): A Microsoft computer operating system with a command-line interface that is used to control many internal computer functions, such as running programs and organizing and maintaining files. [Rigdon, C. J., Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms (Vol. 1), 2016 Eastern Digital Resources, 
                 <a href="https://www.damanhour.edu.eg/pdf/738/dictionaries/Dictionary_of_Computer_and_Internet_Terms_Words.pdf">see the source:</a> </p><br>
               <p class="lead">"e.g. Electroenergetica - Power engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power, and the electrical apparatus connected to such systems. [Wikipedia.com]."</p><br>
               <p class="lead">I am interested in copywriting and this internship gave me the opportunity to improve my writing skills in English. I had to find additional information about the structure of English complex sentences, cultural bound-words, geographical terms, punctuation marks and so on.  </p><br>
               <p class="lead">My task was to translate Romanian content for English speaking students. It quickly became apparent that simply creating a mirror content in English would not be enough. The text should be localized. It must be adopted for the target audience. For example, the machine translation of "studii cu frecventa la zi" would be "up-to-date studies". However, English speaking people use a job collocation such as "full-time". Another examples:  </p><br>
               <p class="lead">My translation internship experience gave me the opportunity to improve my research skills, which are essential for copywriting. Both translation and copywriting require an ability and willingness to do research, especially terminology research (e.g. courses title). I had to analyse different course syllabi used at the UK universities in order to provide a similar content. In addition, I had to spend a lot of time reading about a specific topic (e.g. What does economics mean? What are the specific concepts of the field?). Thus, I have observed that every single word that is available in the dictionaries will have obvious meaning when they are involved in the context. In other words, one and the same Romanian word (economie) may have different translations in different fields (economy, economics). The main difference between Economics and Economy is that economics is the study of the economy or the study of the rational choice of humans. And the Economy is a system, which is concerned about a particular country's production according to the demand and exchange of goods and services. </p><br>
               <p class="lead">There are some skills that I would still like to develop. First, I would like how to use another CAT tools, such as Trados and Memoq. My first step in this context is to use several courses from Udemy.com. Second, it would be great to learn how to translate and localize a website. There is not enough to buy a single course in Udemy.com, because it requires a huge amount of linguistic, cultural and technical knowledge. The more I study, the more I realize I know nothing. </p><br>
